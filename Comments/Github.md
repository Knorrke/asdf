Hey Team, here are a few more tipps.

* Set your username + email by using `git config --global user.name "Ich"` and `git config --global user.email "Ich@web.de"`
Make sure to use the same email address you used to register your github account so github will be able to associate the commit with the correct user
* Snoop around in our repositories on github.com/serlo-org: Github offers "issues", those are bug reports, feature requests etc.
