I tried to push directly. But of course I have to push it only into my github-thingy and then ask kindly for a pull by a pull-request.

ROR: Permission to philer/asdf.git denied to Drinc.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
